## Installing and developing your own project based on this boilerplate

1. Create a new completely! empty project on gitlab.com/ikdoeict, for example my-project
2. Execute following commands on your system (pay attention !)
```shell
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
git pull https://gitlab.com/ikdoeict/joris.maervoet/wmss-boilerplate.git
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/ikdoeict/<your-name>/my-project.git
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/ikdoeict/sanderspaas/2122wmss-il1-SanderSpaas.git
git remote set-url origin git:https://gitlab.com/ikdoeict/sanderspaas/2122wmss-il1-SanderSpaas.git
git push -u origin master
```
3. From now on, you can stage, commit and push as usual.
4. Open the main folder with an IDE (such as PhpStorm or Visual Studio Code)

## Running and stopping the Docker MCE

* Run the environment, using Docker, from your terminal/cmd
```shell
cd <your-project>
docker-compose up
```
* Stop the environment in your terminal/cmd by pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code>
* In order to avoid conflicts with your lab/slides environment, run from your terminal/cmd
```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Installing Twig and DBAL

The MCE is provided with a `composer.json`/`composer.lock` file, providing the Twig and DBAL libraries
* In order to install, run from your terminal/cmd
```shell
docker-compose exec php-web bash
$ composer install
$ exit
```

<!--## About the autoloader

`composer.json` is configured such that the classes in "src/" (and subfolders), and the file "config/database.php" are autoloaded.
* This means there is no need to require these classes anymore in your `public/*.php` scripts.
* You can extend this list yourself in `composer.json`
* When you changed this list, or you created some new classes, let composer know from your terminal/cmd:
```shell
docker exec -it <webcontainer-id> bash
$ composer dump-autoload
$ exit
```-->

## Recipes and troubleshooting

### <code>docker-compose up</code> does not start one or more containers
* Look at the output of <code>docker-compose up</code>. When a container (fails and) exits, it is shown as the last line of the container output (colored tags by container)
* Alternatively, start another terminal/cmd and inspect the output of <code>docker-compose ps -a</code>. You can see which container exited, exactly when.
* Probably one of the containers fails because TCP/IP port 8000, 8080 or 3307 is already in use on your system. Stop the environment, change the port in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> en rerun <code>docker-compose up</code>.
